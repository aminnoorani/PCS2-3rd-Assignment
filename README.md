# PCS2-3rd-Assignment
In this assignment, We want to compare 4 different algorithms to see how they work
in a matter of time. 2 of them which are named as Quick sort and Bubble sort, we only need to check
which one is faster or to see which one has better performance when the list get bigger.
for example in the plot below, we see that how quick sort works when we add elements to the list.
